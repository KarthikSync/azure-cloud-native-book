Microservice systems typically use a combination of these interaction types when executing operations that require cross-service interaction. Letâ€™s take a close look at each and how you might implement them.

Often, one microservice may have the need to *query* another, requiring an immediate response in order to complete an operation. For example, a shopping basket microservice may need product information and a price in order to add an item to its basket. There are a number of approaches for implementing query operations.

## Azure CDN

Sometimes, a microservice may require another microservice to perform an action. For example, the Ordering microservice may need the Shipping microservice to create a shipment for an approved order. Often called a *command message*, the microservice invoking the action, called a Producer, makes a command to another service, the Consumer, by sending it a message as shown below in Figure x.
